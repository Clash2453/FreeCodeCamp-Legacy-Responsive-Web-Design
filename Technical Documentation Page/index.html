                    This is the course work I did for my object oriented programming class, part of my first year of programming in university. The theme of the project is School Management System.

                        The coursework must be completed in three stages, with a deadline for each stage to be submitted to Moodle. After the end of the third stage, a date will be set for a project defense in which the student must demonstrate the functionality of the program as well as answer questions about its implementation. During the development process, each of the stages already handed in is subject to change (should this be necessary).
    
                        The brief must describe the functional requirements that the project will meet, and these must be tailored to the requirements by stage. For original assignments (different from the standard assignment and not repetitive) an additional 5 points will be given.
                        
                        Implementation requirements:
                        
                        The project must demonstrate the following technologies (broken down by stage), for each of which the student must highlight a need for use during the defence:

                        Stage 1
                    
                        1.       Inheritance - need to implement a hierarchy of classes (mandatory);
                        
                        2.       Encapsulation (mandatory);
                        
                        3.       Polymorphism (mandatory);
                        
                        4.       Virtual methods (mandatory);
                        
                        5.       Use of different access modifiers (minimum public and protected) (mandatory);
                        
                        6.       Properties (mandatory);
                        
                        7.       Delegates and events (1pts).

                        Stage 2
                    
                        1.       User interface for working with the program other than console (at least three different forms). The project must demonstrate data transfer between the different forms (up to 8t);
                        
                        2.       Use of specialized programming functionality interacting with the hierarchy built in Stage 1 (e.g.: implementation of graphical objects via System.Drawing, computational processing of information via Math.NET, processing of XML schemas via System.Xml, etc.). Specialized functionality can be proposed by the student depending on his/her interests and preferences (up to 14pts).

                        1.       Storage of information in files by means of serialization (up to 4pts);
                        
                        2.       Use of LINQ (minimum 4 types of operations) (up to 8pts);
                        
                        3.       Separating reusable project logic into a library and removing external library dependencies (up to 4pts).

                <p1 class="info -fs-medium -f-hanzo">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p1>

                <p1 class="info -fs-medium -f-hanzo">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p1>
